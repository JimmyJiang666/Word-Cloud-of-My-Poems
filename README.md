# Word-Cloud-of-My-Poems
This is to create a word cloud figure for my own poems written from 2016-2020. The language processing is done using Jieba library in Python.

The poems are written mainly in Chinese so I used jieba to handle the language processing and filtered out the most 200 frequently used words and built a word cloud picture around them.
.tff files are Chinese font files that are used to create the word cloud.
